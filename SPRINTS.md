# 6. Risk Register & Mitigations per Phase

| Phase | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------|------|------------|--------|------------|
| 0–1 | VAP specification changes invalidate implementation | Medium | High | Implement to interfaces; conformance tests drive implementation; ADR for breaking changes |
| 0–1 | Attention/fraud models insufficient accuracy | High | High | Research sprints first; synthetic data generation; continuous benchmarking; human-in-loop labeling |
| 2 | Pipeline throughput bottleneck at scale | Medium | High | Load test early (Sprint 7); design for horizontal scaling; backpressure + DLQ |
| 2 | ML model serving latency exceeds budget | Medium | Medium | Model optimization (quantization, distillation); batch inference; caching |
| 2 | Fraud arms race outpaces detection | High | High | Red team sprints; bug bounty; threat intel sharing; adaptive retraining |
| 3 | Browser/OS restrictions break evidence collection | Medium | High | Platform-specific strategies; fallback modes; standards advocacy (W3C) |
| 3 | SDK bundle size / performance hurts adoption | Medium | Medium | Strict budgets; tree-shaking; lazy loading; web workers |
| 4 | API design flaws require breaking changes | Low | High | OpenAPI-first design; consumer-driven contracts; long beta |
| 4 | Insufficient beta feedback / adoption | Medium | Medium | Recruit diverse verticals; dedicated support; incentive program |
| 5 | Marketplace liquidity failure (two-sided network) | High | High | Seed supply/demand; guarantee minimum volume; focus on high-value verticals first |
| 5 | Regulatory classification as financial market | Low | Very High | Legal counsel from Sprint 22; compliance by design; jurisdiction strategy |
| All | Key person dependency | Medium | High | Pair programming; documentation; cross-training; bus factor ≥ 2 |
| All | Scope creep beyond charter | Medium | Medium | Sprint goals locked; change control via ADR; charter Section 8 boundaries |
